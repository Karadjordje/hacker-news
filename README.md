# Hacker news website

## Description
This is my attempt at building Hacker news website with their [API](https://github.com/HackerNews/API)

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Getting started
1. Clone the project
2. Project was done using
    - Node LTS 14.4.0 - 64 bit

### Development
- Use `yarn install` to restore npm packages
- All files for development can be found in `/src` folder

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
